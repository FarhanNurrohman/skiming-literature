# skiming-literature

## Problem Sentence
The number of RCT papers released is continuing to increase, those without structured abstracts can be hard to read and in turn slow down researchers moving through the literature. So I create an NLP model to classify abstract sentences into the role they play (e.g. objective, methods, results, etc) to enable researchers to skim through the literature and dive deeper when necessary. Where my data is coming from: PubMed 200k RCT: a Dataset for Sequential Sentence Classification in Medical Abstracts and my model is coming from: Neural networks for joint sentence classification in medical paper abstracts.This project is conducted as part of the course "TensorFlow for Deep Learning".
